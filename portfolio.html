                <strong>
                    High School
                </strong>
                <p>
                    I started learning web development back in High School where I gained knowledge in building websites
                    using Dreamweaver CS6 and Photoshop to build websites.
                    This was the start of a new era in Computer Science. Furthermore, I learned <strong>Python</strong>
                    to enhance my skills in introducing a programming language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After High School, I started learning from Sololearn, which is a platform that allows the developers
                    to learn several programming languages, interact with other developers, and challenge other developers.
                    This helped me as a developer to grow my skills in computer science.

                    College
                </strong>
                <p>
                    I majored in a different field but broke into tech since high school. I am self taught in computer science and would like to 
                    continue working on building and growing as a developer within the computer science field.

                    During college, I've taken several course that entail to computer science such as Python, 
                    basic computer science knowledge and skills, and Data Visualization.

                    After college
                </strong>
                <p>
                    First, I worked at Apex System as a Help Desk Technician to be able to further my journey as a CS Major instead. 
                    This helped with gaining real-world experience and build my computer science skills and background. 
                    As a Help Desk Tech, I worked with Subject Matter Experts, tier 1, 2, and 3, to be able to learn how to create support tickets and 
                    assist several customers with solving their IT, software, hardware, vpn-related issues that the clients were calling about. 
                    This taught me how to use boeing's ticketing system, how to use MS Excel to track the time worked, and enter in the clients information as well for record keeping.
                    I participated in monthly meetings to see how I progress over the month during the calls and see where I stand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 6 months, I landed unpaid internships opportunities at several companies, where I utilized my skills, experience, and background as a developer.
                    I worked with different frontend technologies and tools to be able to build web applications, worked with Python to conduct statistical analyses on several datasets and create a dashboard that summarizes and story tells using Tableau and PowerBI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Up to this day, I continue to work in the computer science field learning and growing my skills, experience, and background. 
                    I created a portfolio of my own that presents all my latest project since I started this journey in the CS field.
