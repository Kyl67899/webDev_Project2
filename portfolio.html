                    <h1>Where it Started</h1>
                    <p>
                        I started learning web development back in High School where I gained knowledge in building
                        websites
                        using <strong>Dreamweaver CS6</strong> and <strong>Photoshop CS6</strong> to build websites.
                        This was the start of a new era in Computer Science. Furthermore, I learned
                        <strong>Python</strong>
                        to enhance my skills in introducing a programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After High School, I started learning from Sololearn, which is a platform that allows the
                        developers
                        to learn several programming languages, interact with other developers, and challenge other
                        developers.
                        This helped me as a developer to grow my skills in computer science.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="college">
                    <h1>College</h1>
                    <p>
                        I majored in a different field but broke into tech since high school. I am self taught in
                        computer science and would like to
                        continue working on building and growing as a developer within the computer science field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During college, I've taken several course that entail to computer science such as Python,
                        basic computer science knowledge and skills, and Data Visualization.
                    </p>

                    <h1>After College</h1>
                    <p>
                        First, I worked at Apex System as a Help Desk Technician to be able to further my journey as a
                        CS Major
                        instead.
                        This helped with gaining real-world experience and build my computer science skills and
                        background.
                        As a Help Desk Tech, I worked with Subject Matter Experts, tier 1, 2, and 3, to be able to learn
                        how to
                        create support tickets and
                        assist several customers with solving their IT, software, hardware, vpn-related issues that the
                        clients
                        were calling about.
                        This taught me how to use boeing's ticketing system, how to use MS Excel to track the time
                        worked, and
                        enter in the clients information as well for record keeping.
                        I participated in monthly meetings to see how I progress over the month during the calls and see
                        where I
                        stand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After 6 months, I landed several unpaid internships opportunities at several companies, where I
                        utilized
                        my skills, experience, and background as a developer.
                        I worked with different frontend technologies and tools to be able to build web applications,
                        worked
                        with Python to conduct statistical analyses on several datasets and created a dashboard that
                        summarizes
                        and story tells using Tableau and PowerBI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Up to this day, I continue to work in the computer science field learning and growing my skills,
                        experience, and background.
                        I created a portfolio of my own that presents all my latest project since I started this journey
                        in the
                        CS field and currently working as a freelancer building websites for different businesses.
